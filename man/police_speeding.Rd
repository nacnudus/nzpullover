General notes and caveats by the New Zealand Police:

This data contains provisional data which is drawn from a dynamic operational
database. This is subject to change as new information is recorded or
recoded.

The data does not include cancelled infringements and proceedings, but does
include minor infringements cleared as Written Traffic Warnings (WTWs) since
the adoption of Police's Written Traffic Warning Policy in 2014. As WTWs do
not have a fee these are not included in monetary value tables.

Police speeding data includes only speed camera detections of vehicles
registered to Police that were exceeding the speed limit. The data does not
include driver occupation or whether the vehicle was being driven while on
Police duty; however it could be reasonably presumed that staff were on duty
in the vast majority of cases.  Only in special circumstances are contract
vehicles and patrol vehicles permitted to be driven whilst off duty.  Police
does not maintain a database of officers issued with speeding fines while
driving Police vehicles. The table containing waived Police speed offences is
a subset of the numbers shown in the top table and include all waived
reasons. Specific reasons cannot be determined without review of individual
files. However, a notice is generally only waived when a Police officer is
undertaking urgent duty driving in response to an incident.  Police employees
who travel in excess of the speed limit are treated no differently to members
of the public, and depending on the circumstances may be subject to further
disciplinary action. All drivers of police vehicles detected travelling in
excess of the speed limit are liable for the relevant penalties unless a
legal defence applies. The Land Transport (Road User) Rule 2004 lists the
legal defences Police have when undertaking urgent duty driving, thereby
outlining the criteria for waiving a notice.

Please note that Police vehicle speeding data from 2014 onward cannot be
compared to previous years due to a change in the way the infringements are
recorded. A change to the recording process means that there has been an
increase in the number of infringements recorded for 2014 when compared to
previous years. This is due to a change of process for speed camera photos of
police vehicles with red and blue flashing lights visible in the photographs.
Notices are now issued for many of these photos, pending an explanation from
the driver rather the previous process of presuming an urgent duty driving
defence and not issuing a notice.  "

Most speed cameras employ radar technology to detect speeding vehicles. The
process of issuing a speed camera notice involves verification of the
resulting vehicle photo to validate the detection. When counting all vehicles
passing speed cameras (i.e., all moving vehicles complying with the speed
limit and otherwise), a small number of detections may involve other causes.
These cannot be reliably excluded from the total number of detected vehicles
as Police record speed camera notice details separately from raw vehicle
counts. The total number of vehicles detected by speed cameras on deployment
may therefore include a small number of false radar detections. Note also
that this data starts from August 2009 as there were some technical issues
affecting the rollout of digital mobile cameras primarily between January and
July 2009.
