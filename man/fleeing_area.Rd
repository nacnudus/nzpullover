General notes and caveats by the New Zealand Police:

This data contains provisional data which is drawn from a dynamic operational
database. This is subject to change as new information is recorded or
recoded.

Policeâ€™s Fleeing Driver Policy is based on the premise that drivers who fail
to stop for Police and who flee to avoid apprehension pose risks to the
public, police employees and themselves. In deciding whether or not to pursue
a fleeing driver, Police must balance their responsibility to protect lives
with their duty to enforce the law. If the decision is made to pursue, Police
must prioritise safety by driving with a high standard of care and
professionalism and in a manner appropriate to the situation. Total fleeing
driver incidents are available with district-level detail only. Approximately
96% of incidents are were recorded with Area-level detail.
