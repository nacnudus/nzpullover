General notes and caveats by the New Zealand Police:

This data contains provisional data which is drawn from a dynamic operational
database. This is subject to change as new information is recorded or
recoded.

During entry, a small number of infringements were coded to an incorrect
Police Area (e.g., there are a small number of red light offences showing in
Wairarapa Area where there are no traffic lights).

The data does not include cancelled infringements and proceedings, but does
include minor infringements cleared as Written Traffic Warnings (WTWs) since
the adoption of Police's Written Traffic Warning Policy in 2014. As WTWs do
not have a fee these are not included in monetary value tables.

Most speed cameras employ radar technology to detect speeding vehicles. The
process of issuing a speed camera notice involves verification of the
resulting vehicle photo to validate the detection. When counting all vehicles
passing speed cameras (i.e., all moving vehicles complying with the speed
limit and otherwise), a small number of detections may involve other causes.
These cannot be reliably excluded from the total number of detected vehicles
as Police record speed camera notice details separately from raw vehicle
counts. The total number of vehicles detected by speed cameras on deployment
may therefore include a small number of false radar detections. Note also
that this data starts from August 2009 as there were some technical issues
affecting the rollout of digital mobile cameras primarily between January and
July 2009.
