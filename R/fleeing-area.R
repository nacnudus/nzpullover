#' General notes and caveats by the New Zealand Police:
#'
#' This data contains provisional data which is drawn from a dynamic operational
#' database. This is subject to change as new information is recorded or
#' recoded.
#'
#' Policeâ€™s Fleeing Driver Policy is based on the premise that drivers who fail
#' to stop for Police and who flee to avoid apprehension pose risks to the
#' public, police employees and themselves. In deciding whether or not to pursue
#' a fleeing driver, Police must balance their responsibility to protect lives
#' with their duty to enforce the law. If the decision is made to pursue, Police
#' must prioritise safety by driving with a high standard of care and
#' professionalism and in a manner appropriate to the situation. Total fleeing
#' driver incidents are available with district-level detail only. Approximately
#' 96% of incidents are were recorded with Area-level detail.
