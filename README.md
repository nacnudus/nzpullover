[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nacnudus/nzpullover.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nacnudus/nzpullover) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/nacnudus/nzpullover?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nacnudus/nzpullover) [![Cran Status](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/nzpullover)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nzpullover/index.html) [![Cran Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/nzpullover)](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/nzpullover)

The nzpullover package makes available road policing data from the New Zealand Police in a convenient 'tidy' form. Offence categories include speed, alcohol, red light, restraints (seatbelts), mobile phone, fleeing drivers, and speeding police vehicles.

The original data published by the New Zealand Police is available as a spreadsheet here: <http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/road-policing-driver-offence-data-january-2009-march-2017>. Please note that this R package is not associated with the New Zealand Police.

The spreadsheet data has been made tidy by using the [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) and [unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) packages. See the scripts in [/data-raw](https://github.com/nacnudus/nzpullover/tree/master/data-raw). Zipped csv files are available in [/inst/extdata](https://github.com/nacnudus/nzpullover/tree/master/inst/extdata).

The New Zealand Police refresh the data approximately quarterly. If this package lags behind, then please open an issue <https://github.com/nacnudus/nzpullover/issues>. The CRAN version will be updated annually.
