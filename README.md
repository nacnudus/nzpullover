# nzpullover

The nzpullover package makes available road policing data from the New Zealand
Police in a convenient 'tidy' form.

The original data published by the New Zealand Police is available as a
spreadsheet here:
[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/road-policing-driver-offence-data-january-2009-september-2016](http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/road-policing-driver-offence-data-january-2009-september-2016).

The spreadsheet data has been made tidy by using the
[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl)
[unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) packages.

The New Zealand Police refreshes the data approximately quarterly.  If this
package lags behind, then please open an issue
[https://github.com/nacnudus/nzpullover/issues](https://github.com/nacnudus/nzpullover/issues).
