# nzpullover 0.4.0

* Updated with data up to March 2018.  The structure of some tables has changed.
    * The datasets `fleeing_area` and `fleeing_district` of fleeing driver
        incidents are now broken down by deaths and serious injuries, crashes,
        incidents, and abandonments.
    * The dataset `driving_offences` has series for speeding offences detected
        by cameras.  These have been replaced by series for speeding offences
        detected by mobile cameras.  Speeding offences detected by static
        cameras are in the new `static_camera` dataset.
* Updated the code for the latest development version of `unpivotr`.

# nzpullover 0.1.0

* Updated with data up to March 2017.

  development version of [`tidyxl`](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl).  Note
  that the source data has changed the spelling of some terms, from `mcg` to
  `µg`:

    - `Lowered adult alcohol limit (250µg breath / 50mg blood) monetary amount  (note: these figures are also included in the 'Alcohol specific monetary amount' table above)`
    - `Under 20 zero alcohol limit (0µg breath / 0mg blood) offences    (note: these figures are also included in the 'Alcohol specific offences' table above)`
